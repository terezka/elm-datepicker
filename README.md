# elm-datepicker

*Updated for Elm 0.18* :sparkles:

A datepicker made in the style of [elm-autocomplete](https://github.com/thebritican/elm-autocomplete). Configuration currently includes:

 * option for using default styling or add your own classes
 * initial date - defaults to current

More to come! Functional right now though! :dizzy:
